# Third-party licenses

This file records license notices for third-party code copied or vendored into
this repository's source tree.

It intentionally does not include license text for package-managed dependencies
from Go modules, npm/pnpm packages, Rust crates, or other lockfile-managed
ecosystems. Those dependencies are checked separately by
`scripts/license-check.sh` against the policy in `grant.yaml`; the generated
SBOM and Grant output are the dependency license report for package-managed
dependencies.
