# AGENTS.md

Map, not encyclopedia. Small by design - follow the paths.
__POOL_SYNTHETIC_IMPORT_BASELINE__
This repository contains Poolside Assistant: desktop and IDE assistant clients,
shared assistant UI packages, ACP support, and `poolside-helper`.

Scoped `AGENTS.md` files override this file for their subtree. Read the scoped
file before editing a domain you have not touched before. `CLAUDE.md` files are
symlinks to `AGENTS.md` — edit `AGENTS.md`, never add a separate `CLAUDE.md`.

New to the repo? Set up with [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md#build-from-source)
(tool versions come from [`.tool-versions`](.tool-versions)), then read
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how changes land.

## The protocol

Poolside Assistant is a client for agents speaking the
[Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/) (ACP). Upstream
protocol and schema documentation live there. Poolside's `_poolside/*`
extension methods are defined in `pkg/acp/README.md`.

## Build and test

Use scoped README files for target-specific commands. Prefer focused tests for
the area touched.

Common entry points:

- Helper: `bazelisk test //pkg/poolside-helper/...`
- UI workspace: `pnpm test`, `pnpm build`
- VS Code assistant: `pnpm -F poolside-assistant test:unit`
- Desktop assistant: `pnpm -F @poolsideai/desktop-assistant check:types`

For UI changes, verify in the running app with spoolside and attach
before/after screenshots as PR evidence — see
[`docs/coding-with-agents.md`](docs/coding-with-agents.md).

## Ways of working

- PRs, issue flow, and where to discuss changes: [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- CI lives in `.github/workflows`. Dependency license checks:
  [`docs/license-checks.md`](docs/license-checks.md).
- Run `pnpm fix:format` before pushing UI changes; `gofmt` is enforced for Go.

## TypeScript and Svelte

For code under `ui/`, use `ui/README.md` as the canonical walkthrough of the
workspace, Svelte patterns, and apps.

- This project uses Node.js and pnpm. Check the root `.tool-versions` file for
  versions.
- Always use `pnpm`, never `npm`.
- Prefer scoped installs such as `pnpm install --filter @poolsideai/<app>...`
  (note the trailing `...`) over a top-level install when working on one app or
  package.
- Read the relevant README under `ui/` before working there.
- Check type errors with editor diagnostics if available; otherwise use
  `pnpm check:types`.
- Fix formatting issues with `pnpm fix:format`.
- Run unit tests with `pnpm test:unit` or a focused package command such as
  `pnpm -F poolside-assistant test:unit`.
- Run unit tests in watch mode with `pnpm test:unit:watch`, or scope the same
  script with `pnpm -F <package>`.
- Run Storybook development servers with a scoped package command such as
  `pnpm -F @poolsideai/assistant storybook`, or with
  `pnpm exec turbo storybook --affected` when using the Turbo task directly.
  Run Storybook tests with `pnpm test:storybook` and watch mode with
  `pnpm test:storybook:watch`.

## Go

- Order files by importance to readers: exported types, tests, and methods
  first; helper methods and unexported types later.
- Suffix methods that must be called when a lock is called Locked, e.g. `startLocked`

### Tests
- In tests, use `testify` `assert`/`require` rather than `t.Error`.
- Use `require` in tests to eliminate possible runtime panics, for example
  `require.Len(t, someSlice, 1)` before accessing a slice index.
- Prefer `assert` for independent post-conditions so one test run reports every
  failure, not just the first one.

## Editing docs

Before adding to this file, ask whether the detail belongs
in a scoped `AGENTS.md`, a package README, or an app README.
