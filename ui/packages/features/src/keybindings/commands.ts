// (see service.ts). Order matters: `COMMAND_GROUPS` is rendered verbatim by the
// settings UI, so the order here is the order users see. Author the page by
// editing this array.
//
// To add a shortcut:
//   1. Add an entry to the appropriate group below (or add a new group).
//   2. `kb.register("<id>", handler)` wherever the behavior lives.
// The `CommandId` union is derived from this array, so step 2 won't compile
// against a typo, and the dev-time audit (see service.ts) warns about commands
// that are declared but never wired.
