// Reports which conversation this surface is viewing to the helper. The
// helper tracks watchers per client connection: a completing turn marks its
// conversation unread only when NO surface is watching it, and activating a
// conversation clears its unread flag for every surface. This is what makes
// the sidebar's unread dot a single shared signal across the desktop app, the
// mobile remote, and IDE hosts instead of a per-surface guess.
//
// Split hosts (VS Code / Visual Studio) report panel visibility from their
// extension process, where it lives; only hosts that render the chat pane in
// the same webview as the sidebar (desktop, mobile) report from here.
//
// Reports are serialized through one promise chain so an activate/deactivate
// pair from a fast conversation switch cannot land out of order, and the
// first report after a webview boot carries reset:true so entries a previous
// webview lifetime left behind stop counting as watched.
