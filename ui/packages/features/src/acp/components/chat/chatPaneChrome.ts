// ChatPaneChrome is the contract between AcpChatPane and its host surface: it
// declares which affordances the surface supplies around the pane, so the pane
// only renders controls that actually do something there. Hosts compose the
// pane by describing their chrome instead of toggling individual desktop-shaped
// booleans:
//
// - Desktop main panel: a collapsible conversations sidebar, the pane-owned
//   conversation header, the legacy inline terminal panel, the rounded
//   desktop window frame.
// - Desktop splits: the same sidebar, but the tab bar replaces the pane header
//   ("none"), terminals open as external split tabs, no frame ("plain").
// - IDE editor panels: no chrome at all (omit the prop) — there is no sidebar
//   to expand, so the pane never offers sidebar actions.
// - Mobile: no sidebar or terminal either, and the shell's own top bar is the
//   single header, so the pane renders none ({ header: "none", frame: "plain" }).
