<!--
  While the fold is open the trigger pins to the top of the transcript and the
  rule pins just under it, so the summary stays readable through contents that
  routinely run several screens long. This works because the trigger, the rule
  and the contents share one block — that block is the sticky containing block,
  so both stay pinned for exactly as long as any of the group is on screen.

  The rule reaches its stop a little BEFORE the trigger reaches its own, because
  it starts out lower (centred on the trigger). So scrolling up, the rule settles
  first, the trigger rides up the last stretch to meet it, and the rule is left
  spanning the full width beneath it.

  No row gap: the trigger and the rule are parked by margins instead, so opening
  a fold moves nothing. The contents restore the gap.
