# Builds poolside-mlx-sidecar and prepares its Metal libraries.
#
# Usage: build.sh [install-dir]
#
# With an install-dir, the binary and metallibs are copied there (while the
# build lock is still held, so a build in another checkout cannot mutate them
# mid-copy) and the install dir is printed on stdout. Without one, the SwiftPM
# bin path inside the shared scratch is printed instead — callers reading
# products straight out of it must tolerate concurrent rebuilds. All build
# output goes to stderr.
#
# The build uses a SwiftPM scratch path shared across checkouts (e.g. git
# worktrees), so heavy dependencies such as swift-syntax compile once per
# machine instead of once per worktree. A lock serializes concurrent
# invocations so parallel worktree builds don't oversubscribe every core.
# Override the location with POOLSIDE_MLX_SIDECAR_SCRATCH_PATH.

# mkdir is atomic, so it doubles as a portable lock; a pid file lets waiters
# reclaim locks left behind by killed builds. Best-effort: two waiters
# reclaiming the same stale lock can in theory race each other past it, and a
# recycled pid can delay reclaim. SwiftPM's own scratch lock still serializes
# the compile in that case, but the patch and metallib steps would race
# unprotected — the window (moments after a build died) is accepted for what
# is a dev/CI convenience wrapper.

# behind another worktree's build exits cleanly instead of being killed by
# the helper's readiness timeout mid-wait and leaving orphaned processes.
