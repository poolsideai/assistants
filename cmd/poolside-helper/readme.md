# `poolside-helper` — the binary

This directory holds the `main` for the helper daemon. The interesting code,
JSON-RPC handlers, ACP proxy, and developer docs live one floor up at
[`pkg/poolside-helper/`](../../pkg/poolside-helper/README.md).

The helper is launched as a long-lived subprocess by each assistant client
(VS Code, Visual Studio, desktop). One process per editor
workspace, communicating over stdio with JSON-RPC framed by the LSP base
protocol. Methods are namespaced `poolside/…` so they can't collide with
LSP itself.

```sh
# Build the binary
bazelisk build //cmd/poolside-helper

__POOL_SYNTHETIC_IMPORT_BASELINE__
poolside-helper --help
```

Assistant client code lives under [`../../ui/apps/`](../../ui/apps/).
