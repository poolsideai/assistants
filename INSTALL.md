# Install Poolside Assistant

To use Poolside Assistant, see
[Install a prebuilt release](#install-a-prebuilt-release).

To build, modify, or contribute to Poolside Assistant, see
[Build from source](#build-from-source).

## Install a prebuilt release

The [install table in the README](./README.md#install) links the latest release
for each surface. The steps below use the releases page directly.

### Desktop app on macOS Apple Silicon

1. Open the [releases page](https://github.com/poolsideai/assistant/releases)
   and open the newest **desktop/** release.
2. Download the `.dmg` asset.
3. Open the `.dmg` and drag **Poolside** to **Applications**.
4. Launch **Poolside** from **Applications**.

### VS Code extension

Install Poolside Assistant from the
[VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=poolside-ai.acp-assistant)
or use a release VSIX. Poolside Assistant requires VS Code 1.85.0 or later.

1. Open the [releases page](https://github.com/poolsideai/assistant/releases)
   and open the newest **vscode-assistant/** release.
2. Download the `.vsix` asset for your platform. See
   [Choose the right VS Code VSIX](#choose-the-right-vs-code-vsix).
3. In VS Code, open **Extensions**, select the ellipsis menu, and choose
   **Install from VSIX...**.
4. Select the downloaded `.vsix` file.

You can also install from a terminal:

```sh
code --install-extension <path-to-vsix>
```

#### Choose the right VS Code VSIX

Use the asset that matches your operating system and CPU architecture:

- `darwin-arm64`: macOS on Apple Silicon
- `darwin-x64`: macOS on Intel
- `linux-arm64`: Linux on ARM64
- `linux-x64`: Linux on x64
- `win32-arm64`: Windows on ARM64
- `win32-x64`: Windows on x64

If you are not sure which platform-specific asset to use, install the universal
VSIX asset.

### Visual Studio extension

Poolside Assistant requires Visual Studio 2022 version 17.9 or later on Windows
amd64.

1. Open the [releases page](https://github.com/poolsideai/assistant/releases)
   and open the newest **vs/** release.
2. Download `poolside-assistant-<version>.vsix`.
3. Close Visual Studio.
4. Open the `.vsix` file to install the extension.
5. Reopen Visual Studio.

### Start using Poolside Assistant

Open Poolside Assistant in the desktop app, VS Code, or Visual Studio. Then see
[Getting started with Poolside Assistant](./docs/getting-started.md) to choose
an agent and start your first conversation.

## Build from source

Use this section if you want to run, modify, or contribute to Poolside Assistant
from source.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the versions of Node.js, pnpm, Go, Bazelisk, just, and golangci-lint
   listed in [`.tool-versions`](./.tool-versions).

   You can install them manually, or install `asdf` and let `make setup` install
   them after you clone the repository. See the
   [asdf installation guide](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html).

2. Install **Rust** before running `make setup` or building the desktop app.
   The setup script requires `rustup` or an existing `rustc` and `cargo`
   installation so it can install the stable Rust toolchain and fetch Tauri
   dependencies. Rust is managed separately from `.tool-versions`. See the
   [Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### Clone and install

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:poolsideai/assistant.git
cd assistant
```

If you use `asdf`, run:

```sh
make setup
```

This installs the pinned tool versions, installs the stable Rust toolchain with
`rustup` if needed, fetches Rust dependencies, and installs UI workspace
dependencies. If neither `rustup` nor an existing Rust toolchain is available,
`make setup` exits with an error.

Setup also installs [mr boxington](https://mr-boxington.jdx.dev) (`mbx`) into
`~/.local/bin`. It is the desktop app's cargo runner: Rust builds from every
checkout and worktree on the machine share one self-pruning cache, so building
in one worktree warms the others. If you skip `make setup`, install it with
`mise use -g mr-boxington` or `cargo install mbx --locked`.

After `make setup` installs new tools, close and reopen your terminal so they
are on your `PATH`.

If you do not use `asdf`, install the required tool versions yourself, then
run:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Run the desktop app

The Tauri desktop assistant is the fastest surface to bring up in development
mode. From the repository root, run:

```sh
pnpm -F @poolsideai/desktop-assistant dev
```

This launches the Tauri shell with hot reload on the Svelte side and starts a
local `poolside-helper`.

### Run the VS Code extension

To build and watch the VS Code extension in development mode:

1. In VS Code, open the repository root.
2. Open the **Run and Debug** view and select **Launch Extension**.
3. Press `F5` or click the green ▶ ("Start Debugging") button.

VS Code opens a separate Extension Development Host window with the extension
loaded. The first launch may take a moment while the extension builds. It
rebuilds automatically as you make changes.

### Run the Visual Studio extension

Visual Studio extension development works on Windows with Visual Studio 2022 and
the Visual Studio extension development workload installed.

1. Build the extension web assets from the repository root in Git Bash or WSL.
   `download:binaries` needs Bash, Unix utilities, and the
   [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated:

   ```sh
   pnpm -C ui/apps/vs-assistant/app download:binaries
   pnpm -C ui/apps/vs-assistant/app build
   ```

2. Open
   [`ui/apps/vs-assistant/poolside-assistant.sln`](./ui/apps/vs-assistant/poolside-assistant.sln)
   in Visual Studio.
3. Press the play button to build and run the extension in an experimental
   Visual Studio instance.

For VM setup notes, helper type generation, and release details, see the
[Visual Studio assistant README](./ui/apps/vs-assistant/README.md).

### Build and test the helper

To build the helper service, run:

```sh
bazelisk build //cmd/poolside-helper
```

To test the helper service, run:

```sh
bazelisk test //pkg/poolside-helper/...
```

For more details, see the
[poolside-helper README](./pkg/poolside-helper/README.md).

### Run tests

To run all UI tests, run:

```sh
pnpm test
```

To run helper tests, run:

```sh
bazelisk test //pkg/poolside-helper/...
```

To run tests for only one package, scope the command to that package:

```sh
pnpm -F poolside-assistant test:unit
pnpm -F @poolsideai/assistant test:unit
pnpm -F @poolsideai/desktop-assistant check:types
```

### Next steps for contributors

- [Work on Poolside Assistant with coding agents](./docs/coding-with-agents.md).
- Read the scoped [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the area you plan to change.

## Troubleshooting

- **The VSIX does not install or the extension does not load**: Make sure you
  downloaded the VSIX for your operating system and CPU architecture. If in
  doubt, use the universal VSIX asset.
- **The extension is not visible after installing the VSIX**: Reload VS Code
  and confirm **Poolside Assistant** is enabled in **Extensions**.
- **`code --install-extension` fails**: Install the `code` command from VS
  Code's **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** command, or use
  **Install from VSIX...** in the Extensions view.
- **macOS blocks the desktop app**: Open **System Settings > Privacy &
  Security** and allow the app to open, or Control-click the app and choose
  **Open**.
- **`make setup` fails**: Install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) first, or
  install the versions in `.tool-versions` by hand.
- **Tauri build fails**: Make sure you have a Rust toolchain
  (`rustup`) installed and a recent stable version.
- **VS Code dev host does not start**: Delete `ui/apps/vscode-assistant/dist`
  and re-run `pnpm -F poolside-assistant dev`.
- **Helper does not start in the editor**: Check the editor's developer
  console / output panel; the helper logs the port it is listening on.
  See the [poolside-helper README](./pkg/poolside-helper/README.md) for
  debugging guidance.
