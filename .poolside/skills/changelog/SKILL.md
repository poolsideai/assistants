# Assistant Changelog Generation

Generate per-surface changelogs (Desktop and/or VS Code) from the PRs merged
since each surface's last release. Output is grouped into **Headlines** and
**Other**.

## Release model (read this first)

Releases are tagged as `desktop/vX.Y.Z`, `vscode-assistant/vX.Y.Z`, and
`helper/v0.0.N`. Desktop and VS Code are released independently from exact
`main` commits; there are no release PRs or committed version-bump commits.

For Desktop and VS Code, even minor versions are Stable and odd minor versions
are Preview. Always use the previous tag from the same product, channel, and tag
prefix as the lower boundary. A temporary VS Code Marketplace app has its own
`vscode-<slug>/vX.Y.Z` prefix and must never use `vscode-assistant` history.

## Steps

1. **Fetch tags and identify the product lineage.**
   ```bash
   git fetch --tags
   gh release list --limit 50
   ```

   Defaults are `desktop` for Desktop and `vscode-assistant` for VS Code. If the
   request is for a temporary Marketplace app, obtain its exact tag prefix from
   the release request or annotated tag metadata.

2. **Generate the canonical tag-bounded draft.** Prefer the tested release
   helper over constructing a range manually:
   ```bash
   pnpm -F @poolsideai/release-helper find-version changelog desktop \
     --channel stable --head <release-sha>

   pnpm -F @poolsideai/release-helper find-version changelog vscode \
     --channel nightly --tag-prefix vscode-assistant --head <release-sha>
   ```

   When reviewing an already-created release plan, use its `previousTag` and
   `sourceSha` exactly:
   ```bash
   pnpm -F @poolsideai/release-helper find-version changelog <product> \
     --prev <previousTag> --head <sourceSha>
   ```

3. **Inspect the exact tag range when manual curation is needed.**
   ```bash
   git log --first-parent --oneline <previousTag>..<sourceSha>
   ```
   Each squash-merged commit normally ends in `(#NNN)`. There is no release PR
   to include or exclude.

4. **Pull metadata + changed files for each PR** (author + surface detection):
   ```bash
   for pr in NNN NNN ...; do
     gh pr view $pr --json number,title,author,url,body \
       --jq '{n:.number,t:.title,a:.author.login,u:.url}'
     gh pr view $pr --json files --jq '.files[].path'
   done
   ```

5. **Classify each PR by surface** (see rules below).

6. **Write the changelog** in the output format below, one section per surface.

## Surface classification

Decide by the files a PR touches:

| Files touched | Surface |
| --- | --- |
| `ui/packages/features/**`, `ui/packages/components/**`, `ui/packages/assistant/**`, `ui/config/**` | **Shared** → both surfaces (the ACP conversation UI) |
| `ui/apps/desktop-assistant/**` (esp. `src-tauri/`) | Desktop |
| `ui/apps/vscode-assistant/**` | VS Code |
| `pkg/`, `cmd/` (helper only), `docs/`, `*.md`, `scripts/`, `.vscode/launch.json` | **Not user-facing** → exclude from both |

**Critical nuance:** some features live in the *shared* `features/src/acp`
package but are **Desktop-only** because the VS Code extension delegates those to
the editor itself. Desktop-only IDE features:

- App **sidebar** (project/chat/branch tree)
- **cmd-K** conversation picker / command palette
- Integrated **terminal** and multi-**pane** layout
- Git **diff panel**
- Native OS **notifications**

When a PR in `features/src/acp` is about one of these (title/body mention
"sidebar", "cmd-k", "terminal", "pane", "diff panel", "desktop notification"),
classify it **Desktop-only** even though the code is shared. Verify with:
```bash
# If these return no hits, the feature is Desktop-only (VS Code doesn't render it):
rg -il "conversation picker|diff panel|command palette" ui/apps/vscode-assistant/src
```
The genuinely shared chat UI — prompt editor, session/turn rendering, plan/todo,
model picker, interrupted-turn layout — ships to **both**.

Many PRs touch a shared package *and* `vscode-assistant/**` or
`desktop-assistant/**` (e.g. an app icon, or a feature wired into both hosts) —
those are **both**.

## Output format

Two sections (Desktop, VS Code). Each has **Headlines** (big user-facing features
/ redesigns) and **Other** (smaller features, fixes, polish). Skip a subsection
if empty.

```
Headlines:

* SUMMARY - [#NNN](URL) @user

Other:

* SUMMARY - [#NNN](URL) @user
```

- URL form: `https://github.com/poolsideai/assistants/pull/NNN`.
- `@user` is the PR author's GitHub login (`.author.login`).
- **Group** related PRs into one entry when they form a coherent story; place each
  PR link next to its author:
  `* SUMMARY - [#1](URL) @userA, [#2](URL) @userB`
- **Split** one PR into multiple entries when it ships multiple changelog-worthy
  features — reuse the same `[#NNN](URL) @user` on each entry.
- SUMMARY is user-facing: describe the outcome, not the implementation.

## Guidance

- Headlines: net-new features, redesigns, brand changes (e.g. new app icon).
  Everything else — fixes, polish, small UX tweaks — goes to Other.
- The Desktop list is a superset: shared PRs + Desktop-only PRs. The VS Code list
  is shared PRs only (unless a PR touches `vscode-assistant/**` specifically).
- Close by flagging any borderline Desktop-only-vs-shared calls so the user can
  correct the split.
