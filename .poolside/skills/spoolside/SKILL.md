# 🧵 Spoolside: App QA + Process Manager

Interacts with Poolside VS Code and desktop app webviews via Playwright. The user starts
a target with `spoolside vscode up` or `spoolside desktop up`; commands then execute in ~100ms.

Also includes a **process manager** for long-running services. Any command wrapped with
`spoolside manage run` can be listed, restarted, and have its logs inspected — enabling
autonomous agents to recover crashed services without user intervention.

## When To Use Spoolside

- Use spoolside by default for **all product feature and bug work** to validate behavior in the real extension UI.
- For bug fixes, treat screenshots as mandatory evidence:
  1. Reproduce in spoolside and take a **before** screenshot.
  2. Apply the fix.
  3. Reproduce again and take an **after** screenshot.
- Prefer `spoolside component @ref` over source grep when tracing UI ownership. It shows the Svelte component chain and file paths for an element selected from `snapshot`.

## Commonly Managed Services

| ID | Command | Description |
|----|---------|-------------|
| `spoolside-s<slot>` | `spoolside vscode up` (auto-managed) | The spoolside VS Code window. Restartable via `spoolside manage restart spoolside-s<slot>`. |
| `desktop-s<slot>` | `spoolside desktop up` (auto-managed) | The spoolside desktop app target. Restartable via `spoolside manage restart desktop-s<slot>`. |
| _(varies)_ | `spoolside manage run pnpm storybook` | Storybook dev server, or any other long-running dev service. |

## Setup

The `spoolside` CLI must be on PATH. **If `command -v spoolside` fails**, run the installer first:

```bash
"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/ui/packages/spoolside/install.sh"
```

The server must be running. **When any command fails:**

1. Run `spoolside status`. Its output tells you exactly what's wrong and what to do.
2. **Relay the output verbatim to the user.** The error messages already contain the correct commands to run. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or invent your own setup instructions — they will be wrong. Copy-paste the error output as-is.

**You cannot start the server yourself.** These are long-running processes that the user manages.

## Worktree Context

- In worktree flows, agents usually already have a running spoolside target with worktree-scoped ports and service IDs.
- Check your current slot/ports with:
  - `spoolside worktree status`
  - `spoolside worktree env`
- `spoolside vscode up --acp` starts the VS Code worktree profile with `poolside.agentMode`
  set to `acp`; `--lsp` sets it to `classic`. Omitting both preserves the copied
  VS Code setting.
- `spoolside desktop up --color "#1f6feb" --worktree-name agent-name` starts a
  Tauri desktop app instance with a distinct title, bundle identifier, dev port,
  spoolside port, and visible color marker.
- `spoolside worktree up` is a legacy alias for `spoolside vscode up`.
- Generic commands such as `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `click`, `fill`, `text`, and
  `js` auto-select the only running target. If both VS Code and desktop are
  running in the current worktree, pass `--vscode` or `--desktop`.
- If spoolside renders garbled log output instead of the extension UI, restart the managed spoolside process:
  1. `spoolside manage list`
  2. `spoolside manage restart <id>` (typically `spoolside-s<slot>`)

## Quick Start

Commands auto-recover the webview if it's closed — no need to check `status` first.
Chain multiple commands with `--`:

```bash
spoolside sendMessage "Hello world" -- waitForMessageCount 1 30000 -- getLastResponse
spoolside snapshot                    # accessibility tree with @refs
spoolside --desktop snapshot          # choose target when multiple are running
spoolside click @e3                   # click element
spoolside screenshot -o /tmp/spoolside.png
```

## Command Reference

### Meta

Go diagnostics target `poolside-helper`; Rust diagnostics target the desktop Tauri
shell.

### Panels
The Poolside sidebar is the default panel. The "Review Changes" diff view (opened
via the **Review** button on the sandbox-changes banner when the agent edits
files in the disk-access-limited sandbox) is a separate webview panel. Generic
commands (snapshot, screenshot, click, fill, hover, scroll, screenshotElement,
text, html, js, component) operate on the **currently selected panel**;
Poolside-specific commands always target the sidebar.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `listPanels` | List all live webview panels (* = current) |
| `selectPanel "name"` | Switch the current panel for generic commands. Fuzzy match supported (e.g. `selectPanel review` matches "Review Changes"). |
| `getCurrentPanel` | Print the current panel name |

```bash
# Capture the diff view that opens when the agent edits a file
spoolside listPanels
spoolside selectPanel "Review Changes" -- snapshot -- screenshot --webview -o /tmp/diff.png
spoolside selectPanel "Poolside" -- sendMessage "next prompt"
```

### Poolside
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|

| `waitForMessageCount <N> [timeout]` | Wait for N message pairs (user+response) |
| `getLastResponse` | Get text of last assistant message |
| `getMessageCount` | Get current message pair count |
| `newConversation [--project NAME \| --worktree NAME]` | Click "New conversation". On VS Code: clicks the chat-header button (`aria-label="New conversation"`).

| `selectConversation "title"` or `selectConversation --index N` | Switch conversation by case-insensitive title substring or by global index from `listConversations`. Errors on zero or ambiguous matches. |
| `getCurrentConversation` | Title (and agent name) of the currently selected sidebar row, or "(no conversation is currently selected)". |
| `restartACPServer "agent-server"` | Restart one ACP agent subprocess by configured server name, e.g. `codex-acp` or `poolside`. |

| `selectCommand "name"` | Execute a slash command from menu |
| `getConfigs` | List each session config option (Mode, Model, etc.) with its current value |
| `setConfig <name> <value>` | Open the dropdown for `<name>` (case-insensitive substring) and click `<value>`. Errors clearly on zero or ambiguous matches. |

### Projects & worktrees (desktop only)

These commands target the desktop sidebar tree (Project › Worktree › Conversation). They error if run against a VS Code target. Add-project is intentionally not exposed — it triggers a native OS folder picker that Playwright can't drive.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `listProjects` | Project tree summary (expanded/collapsed + worktree count) |
| `listWorktrees [--project NAME]` | Worktrees per project; filter by name substring |
| `openProject "name"` | Expand a collapsed project section |
| `closeProject "name"` | Collapse a project (errors if the UI doesn't support collapse-by-header) |
| `removeProject "name"` | Open the project kebab and click "Remove project". No confirmation. |
| `createWorktree [--project NAME]` | Click "Add worktree for X". Name is server-assigned; the command returns the new worktree's name once it appears (15s timeout). Defaults to the only project if just one is present. |
| `removeWorktree "name"` | Hover the worktree row and click "Archive worktree X". No confirmation. |
| `openWorktree "name"` | Click the worktree row main button (switches workspace). |

### VS Code chrome (vscode only)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `openChat` | Click the Poolside activity bar icon; falls back to `Focus on Poolside View` command palette entry. |
| `focusChat` | Run the `Focus on Prompt Input` command (`cmd+escape` keybinding). |
| `toggleSidebar` | Run the built-in `Toggle Primary Side Bar Visibility` command. |

### Manage (Process Manager)
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `manage list` | List all managed processes (ID, command, PIDs, status, uptime, restarts) |
| `manage run [--name <id>] <command...>` | Wrap a command — transparent stdout/stderr, but trackable and restartable |
| `manage restart <id>` | Restart a managed process (kills child, respawns same command) |
| `manage stop <id>` | Stop a managed process and its wrapper |
| `manage logs <id> [--tail N]` | Show last N lines of captured output (default 100) |

### Refs
After `snapshot`, use `@e1`, `@e2`... as selectors:
```bash
spoolside snapshot       # shows @e1 [button] "Send", @e2 [textbox] "Message"...
spoolside click @e1         # click the Send button
spoolside fill @e2 "hello"  # fill the Message textbox
```

## Flags
| Flag | Applies to | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `-c` / `--compact` | snapshot | Remove empty structural elements |
| `-d N` / `--depth N` | snapshot | Limit tree depth |
| `-s SEL` / `--selector SEL` | snapshot | Snapshot subtree under CSS selector |
| `-D` / `--diff` | snapshot | Diff against previous snapshot |
| `--webview` | screenshot | Screenshot only the webview |
| `-o PATH` | screenshot | Output path for screenshot |
